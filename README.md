## General info
Some simple unit tests that were created for Web API regarding books in a bookstore. Models were created and controllers were added, with data being stored as a list.  Asynchronous methods, as well as some using IHttpActionResult interface, are to be found within a controller and a test marked as ‘simple’.
A BookController, on the other hand, has been scaffolded with actions using Entity Framework. BookstoreContext class and IBookstoreAppContext interface are used here, for dependency injection purposes. Some context for the test has been set, and tests were run.
